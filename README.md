This repository hosts the solutions to the set of programming exercises assigned in the Computer Graphics and Interaction Systems course at the University of Ioannina that guide learners through the foundational aspects of OpenGL, showcasing the creation of graphical applications. From rendering basic 2D visualizations like shapes and patterns to the complexities of 3D modeling, camera movements, and dynamic object interactions, this collection illustrates the step-by-step acquisition of OpenGL skills. The exercises progressively build upon one another, demonstrating essential techniques in computer graphics and user interaction within the OpenGL framework.

Overview

The exercise set is divided into three main parts, each focusing on distinct aspects of graphics programming:

•	Exercise 1-A: Introduction to 2D graphics by drawing a triangle surrounded by periodically appearing rhombuses.

•	Exercise 1-B: Creation of a 3D trapezoidal prism and the implementation of basic camera functionalities.

•	Exercise 1-C: Simulation of falling fireballs from the sky, demonstrating collision detection, texture application, and camera movement modifications.

Installation and Running

Each part of the exercise suite is contained within its source code file (Source-A.cpp, Source-B.cpp, and Source-1C.cpp). To compile and run any part of the exercises, ensure you have the GLFW, GLEW, and GLM libraries installed on your system 

Features and Controls

•	General Controls: The application can be terminated by pressing the Space bar.

•	Exercise 1-A: Demonstrates basic 2D drawing functionalities. A rhombus appears around a central triangle in periodic sequences.

•	Exercise 1-B: Introduces 3D object rendering and simple camera controls for viewing a trapezoidal prism from different angles.

•	Exercise 1-C: Adds dynamic elements such as falling fireballs, demonstrating collision detection, texturing, and advanced camera movement.

Dependencies

•	GLFW for window management

•	GLEW for managing OpenGL extensions

•	GLM for mathematics
